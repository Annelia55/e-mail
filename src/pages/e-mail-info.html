                <h2>Bulgari Art Award</h2>
                   <p>
                   The Bulgari Art Award is an annual award to support contemporary Australian painting.
                   Each year, the Gallery identifies a significant painting by a mid-career Australian artist to be acquired for the collection.
                   The award, sponsored by Bulgari, consists of $50,000 for acquisition of the painting and a residency for the artist in Italy valued at $30,000. The total award of $80,000 makes it one of the most valuable art awards in Australia.

            <p>Mrs Beryl Whiteley (1917–2010) generously allocated funds for the scholarship in memory of her son, Brett Whiteley, both to encourage excellence in painting and to offer young artists the same opportunity to develop their careers as were afforded.</p>
